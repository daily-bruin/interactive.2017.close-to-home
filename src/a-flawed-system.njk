<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>aavo Monkkonen, associate professor of urban planning at the UCLA Luskin School
of Public Affairs, studies the relationship between land-use regulations and
segregation of housing by income in California. Monkkonen said part of the
housing crisis in West Los Angeles is due to strict, outdated zoning regulations
in densely populated areas. Consequently, housing costs have risen, thereby
excluding low-income populations. Propositions such as
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-explainer-measure-s-20170220-story.html">Measure S</a>,
which would have restricted building across Los Angeles, were voted against
earlier this year, and
<a href="http://dailybruin.com/2017/10/04/westwood-residents-concerned-over-proposals-for-new-student-housing/">UCLA’s proposal</a>
to building five new housing structures in Westwood was also contested by the
local government. In particular, Monkkonen discussed the housing crisis in
Westwood, as the municipality has been struggling to accommodate an influx of
new renters and buyers in the past 15 years. The Daily Bruin’s Andrea Henthorn
and Meghan Hodges spoke with Monkkonen to discuss the implications of his
research on housing in Westwood and its effects on UCLA students and faculty.</p>
<p><span class="interview-font">Daily Bruin</span> Can you explain your research in housing markets and policy?</p>
<p><span class="interview-font">Paavo Monkkonen</span> I started studying local opposition to new housing development
because I think it is an underaddressed issue in California. One of the major
reasons there’s not enough housing being built is outdated zoning laws, and the
reason we can’t change them is because of an empowered system of local
opposition. It’s extremely inequitable in terms of who has the power to stop
development, so historically the zoning laws and maps that we have are quite
old. And when they were set up, they were set up to to exclude low-income,
nonwhite families from parts of the city where single-housing homes would be
built.</p>
<p><span class="interview-font">DB</span> Why have zoning laws not been updated?</p>
<p><span class="interview-font">PM</span> People don’t talk about zoning enough. There’s a background idea in the U.S.
that your house increasing in value is because you’ve done something, or because
your community’s good, but that’s especially wrong in a metropolitan area. The
metropolitan region grows horizontally, so the central parts inevitably get more
valuable.</p>
<p>(In these areas), we don’t have enough supply; the fine-grained issue in adding
supply is where would we add it? The existing zoning is mostly in poor parts of
the city, and that’s why there’s all these fights about gentrification. We don’t
talk enough about building homes in the rich parts of the city. Partly it’s a
frustration with the city government, where they’re talking a lot about a
crisis, but the solutions they’re proposing are very mild. One of the issues is
75 percent of residential land is zoned for single-family housing only. I would
love the mayor to say we need to upzone some of that.</p>
<p><span class="interview-font">DB</span> How does your research intersect with housing at UCLA?</p>
<p><span class="interview-font">PM</span> One of the fundamental problems with U.S. housing policy is that homeowners
get rich when there’s a supply shortage, and renters get evicted. All renters
are vulnerable, and when you move as a renter is when your rent changes. Since
students are in transition usually, they’re hit by rent changes. Not to mention,
they’re young and don’t have incomes.</p>
<p>UCLA does a great job of getting minority, low-income, first-generation
students, which is important and great, but if we can’t commit to giving them
housing, then we’re (holding back) people without the resources to attend UCLA.
It would only make it easier for low-income families to send their kids to UCLA
if there was housing.</p>
