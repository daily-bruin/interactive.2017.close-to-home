  <p>Beginning</p>
  <p>Going to sleep each night brings a new dream, and a new adventure.</p>
  <p>“I think I have control of my dreams, so I can go anywhere I want to go,” X said. “Nothing is ever too scary or major for
    me to handle (in my dreams).”</p>
  <p>X is a fifth-year gender studies student who has experienced homelessness as a UCLA student. She has chosen to remain anonymous
    under the pseudonym X, which reflects her identity as gender non-conforming.</p>
  <p>Growing up in Compton, X lived with her mother, two older sisters and occasionally her grandmother. For much of her childhood,
    her family lived below the poverty line.</p>
  <p>“My mom had schizophrenia and she didn’t have the medical resources she needed,” X said. “Taking care of the family was
    put on her children.”</p>
  <p>X said she knew she wanted to go to UCLA one day after going on a field trip to campus in elementary school.</p>
  <p>“It was a way for me to get out of my household and make opportunities for myself,” X said.</p>
  <p>X had aspirations of becoming a doctor when she started attending UCLA, but she found little representation of students
    of color or LGBTQ students in the Biology Department.</p>
  <p>“I found my way to gender studies and they were supportive (of my identity),” X said. “I was able to learn about myself,
    and things that I found were relevant to the sciences that needed to (then) be applied.”</p>
  <p>Despite finding a place in the gender studies department, X said her studies were disrupted by periods of housing insecurity.</p>
  <p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
  <p>Housing Situation, Homelessness and food insecurity</p>
  <p>The 1993, two-toned sedan that X bought before beginning classes at UCLA became her shelter as she bounced between living
    in the dorms and couch-surfing during winter quarter of 2016.</p>
  <p>At the time, X said she had been financially supporting herself and her mother by working two jobs while balancing a full
    course load.</p>
  <p>X said when she found herself in financial crisis, she researched her options on campus, and contacted the Economic Crisis
    Response Team, or ECRT, for assistance.
  </p>
  <p>“They were helpful in certain ways,” X said.</p>
  <p>However, once the Office of Student Affairs connected her with ECRT, she said she found the programs were ultimately unsympathetic.
    They put her in a university apartment, but she said UCLA Housing and Student Affairs did not give any consequences to
    the randomly assigned roommates she said discriminated against her.</p>
  <p>The first day X arrived at the apartment, her key did not work. She said she knocked on the door, and saw people looking
    back at her through the peephole, but they did not let her in. She said she had to contact UCLA Housing to give her access
    instead.</p>
  <p>“(The roommates) didn’t say hi or welcome,” X said. “They said, ‘We like to keep things clean around here.’”</p>
  <p>While X was living in the apartment, she said the other roommates, who were white, ignored her, but acted friendly with
    each other.</p>
  <p>“They let me know I was unwelcome as a Black student, and as someone who is gender non-conforming and queer,” X said.</p>
  <p>She said her roommates stole her property and told her they did not want to live with her because of her disability. X
    said she was managing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and was registered with the Center for Accessible Education.</p>
  <p>X said she spoke with a UCLA housing mediator to manage the discomfort she felt in her apartment, and said the mediator
    confirmed discrimination was common in UCLA housing due to race, gender and sexuality.</p>
  <p>“After that mediation with UCLA that confirmed (discrimination was common), they moved me to a more expensive unit and
    said (it was) for safety,” X said. “They gave the apartment to my roommates and moved me to a more expensive unit.”</p>
  <p>She said UCLA Housing suggested the move to a different unit in University Housing would be for her safety, but X added
    that disciplinary action was not taken with her roommates.</p>
  <p>X said UCLA did not adjust her financial aid package to compensate for the increased price, and that the university then
    randomly assigned X to a roommate in crisis. While in this unit, X said her roommate assaulted her.</p>
  <p>“The roommate deteriorated to the point where she had a breakdown,” X said. “She began to throw plates at me, ... she started
    smashing stuff … (and) it ended with her reaching for a knife.”</p>
  <p>X said she tried to disarm her roommate, and immediately called UCLA Housing, requesting medical assistance. Instead, however,
    X said they dispatched campus police, who then called LAPD.</p>
  <p>X said the police acted violently toward her and her roommate.She added the police shoved the roommate facedown on the
    sofa while continuing to tighten her handcuffs.
  </p>
  <p>She added that UCLA Housing said it was her responsibility to follow up with the roommate after the incident, and then
    placed her in an even higher cost, single studio apartment without adjusting her financial aid.</p>
  <p>X said she received approval to have a therapy cat in the studio apartment. She named the cat Aset, after a star system
    with a history connecting to African people.
  </p>
  <p>Aset became a part of X’s artistic process, which she used as a way to channel her traumatic experiences, she said.</p>
  <p>“(Aset) grew up watching me paint, so he used to sit on my lap when I was painting (and) point to colors on the color palette,”
    X said.</p>
  <p>X said she had to give up her therapy animal because she was unable to keep up with payments she accrued between the two
    apartments, and consequently lost her housing for the summer of 2016. She said she was homeless from June 2016 until
    January 2017.</p>
  <p>By the time she became homeless, X said she stopped reaching out to campus services because she felt she was being blamed
    for experiencing poverty.</p>
  <p>“I met with ECRT, Student Affairs, LGBTQ Center, the Office of Diveristy, (but) people would listen and not change,” X
    said. “Nothing changed.”</p>
  <p>X began adjusting to her new schedule while managing housing insecurity.</p>
  <p>“It was a struggle to be homeless because I still have these classes I need to take, but when I leave this class I have
    to figure out where I’m going to park my car,” X said. “You can’t rest because there’s so much going on, and you have
    to balance school and a job and you don’t feel safe.”</p>
  <p>X said she went to the CPO Food Closet during her time as homeless, but did not find the options appealing.</p>
  <p>“It’s like the canned food no one wants to eat at food drives,” X said. “But if you don’t have a can opener, how are you
    going to eat it?”</p>
  <p>She added she has recently visited the CPO Food Closet located in the UCLA Student Activities Center, and that she considers
    the current options better than the ones she saw last year.</p>
  <p>X added there were times during the last year when her life did not feel sustainable. She added her focus was on survival
    after experiencing several traumatic events.</p>
  <p>“There were points where I couldn’t envision myself in the future,” X said.</p>
  <p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
  <p>Intervention</p>
  <p>In December of 2016, X said that she was facing an enrollment hold on her UCLA account because she had an unpaid housing
    balance. The unpaid housing balance affected her financial aid disbursement.</p>
  <p>She then reached out to a faculty mentor whom she took a class with, visiting professor Beth Ribet, to receive additional
    support.</p>
  <p>After X explained how university policies contributed to her homelessness, Ribet requested the involvement of three of
    X’s other professors, including professors Grace Hong, Claudia Peña and Sarah Haley, who quickly became her personal
    team of faculty advocates.</p>
  <p>“As an individual student, I didn’t have that much power,” X said.</p>
  <p>By winter quarter 2017, X said UCLA threatened her with suspension because of her unpaid housing balance, and she added
    by that time her financial aid and enrollment were suspended.</p>
  <p>Ribet said that she, Hong, Haley and Peña intervened with the Office of Student Affairs on X’s behalf. They drafted a several
    page memoranda detailing what had happened to X while living in UCLA Housing. Next, Ribet said they visited the Office
    of Student Affairs in person to restore X’s enrollment and financial aid.</p>
  <p>X said she as she continued to have faculty intervene for her in the Office of Student Affairs, the office began to cooperate
    with her in order to comply with X’s disability accommodations, among other reasons.</p>
  <p>“That was all within the week we all found out that X was about to lose complete access to UCLA,” Ribet said.</p>
  <p>Ribet said she recalls receiving an email the night before X was supposed to lose access notifying her the enrollment holds
    had been lifted. She added X then enrolled in her classes, but was consequently dropped the following week because of
    a non-payment hold with the Financial Aid Office.</p>
  <p>Again, Ribet and the professors intervened. She said Student Affairs would not remove the hold until X had completed all
    of her coursework for which she still had ‘incompletes’ from spring 2016.</p>
  <p>She added that while X was homeless and struggling with the holds, X finished writing the final two essays to complete
    her course from spring.</p>
  <p>“After some bureaucratic mixups, her financial aid was restored,” Ribet said. She added although grade changes had been
    approved, Student Affairs had difficulty locating the record.</p>
  <p>Ribet said X was then placed in emergency housing before settling in regular housing. However, X had requested individual
    housing following experiences with randomly assigned roommates she said were traumatic, but the cost of her studio apartment
    exceeded her total financial aid package and amount allocated for living expenses.</p>
  <p>Ribet said that X appealed her remaining housing debt with UCLA, and eventually had her housing payments from the year
    prior waived.</p>
  <p>In the Spring of 2017, Ribet said X was subjected to another financial aid hold, which turned out to be a university error.</p>
  <p>“To keep getting those notices was such a hard burden on X ... (if) every time you’re told your financial aid is being
    taken away, you wound up homeless,” Ribet said.</p>
  <p>X said she has since faced an additional enrollment hold during summer 2017 due to a $30 ASUCLA textbook fee. She added
    although ASUCLA is not a UCLA entity, they have access to freeze student enrollment&gt; can we check this?</p>
  <p>“I’ve noticed this with other students,” Ribet said. “When professors don’t cooperate (with a student’s disability accommodation),
    or don’t agree to give a student the accommodation they’re entitled to, it’s often not resolved … (and) UCLA doesn’t
    step in (to resolve it).”</p>
  <p>“When I was homeless I felt like someone coming out of an abusive relationship would feel like,” X said. “I felt like I
    was in an abusive relationship with UCLA.”
  </p>
  <p>Professor Grace Hong, who teaches in both the Asian American Studies and Gender Studies departments, said she has witnessed
    X be discriminated against by different UCLA entities.</p>
  <p>“The level of dismissiveness, disrespect, I would even say contempt, that I have personally seen UCLA staff show to X in
    front of me… has been shocking,” Hong said.
  </p>
  <p>On one occasion when she accompanied X to the Student Affairs Office to address her financial aid concerns, Hong said she
    thought the financial aid officer acted like a collections agency by asking X how much total money she owned.</p>
  <p>Hong added on another occasion, UCLA Housing employees cast doubt on whether the instances of discrimination and abuse
    X reported actually happened by using conditional language: ‘if’ assault and discrimination occurred, not ‘when.’</p>
  <p>Ribet added that at a meeting with both UCLA Housing and the Office of Student Affairs, she said she remembers hearing
    an Office of Student Affairs employee say X had been making poor financial choices, and implied that was part of the
    reason she was homeless.</p>
  <p>“They had judgments about her being a caretaker...for a mentally ill parent,” Ribet said.</p>
  <p>Hong added that not only did she think Student Affairs implied X must be mismanaging her finances, but that the four faculty
    members who were identifying themselves as her advocates would no longer want to advocate for X if she had been financially
    irresponsible.</p>
  <p>“There was this assumption that once (Student Affairs) explained to us how much they had tried to help, and (that) X had
    made these bad choices and wasn’t deserving of more help, that we would fall in line in pathologizing X,” Hong said.
  </p>
  <p>Hong said her experience helping X navigate various student support systems has changed her perspective of how the university
    attempts to support students.</p>
  <p>“The bureaucratic insanity that is housing, student affairs, CAE, financial aid, ECRT, the registrar...makes it hard to
    see who to go to and who is in charge of what,” Hong said.</p>
  <p>She added she believes the system ultimately negatively affects diversity on campus. Hong said that oftentimes, underrepresented
    students can only find safe comfortable environments in activist groups.</p>
  <p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
  <p>Looking Forward</p>
  <p>X is currently in a University Housing studio apartment and is preparing for law school.
  </p>
  <p>She wants to share her story now, before she graduates, because she knows there are other students who haven’t been able
    to come forward about similar situations.
  </p>
  <p>“I’m tired all the time and still going through a lot of trauma,” X said. “I know I’m a survivor, I know it takes a lot
    of strength to have gotten through all of this, to survive everything UCLA has thrown at me.”</p>
  <p>Painting, photography and poetry are outlets for X’s stress and trauma. She even performs stand-up comedy when she has
    time between work and classes.</p>
  <p>“I use art as a form of healing and activism,” X said. “I work with students (in local, underserved communities) where
    we write poetry (and) draw on photos to express how different forms of oppression impact us.”</p>
  <p>X said she plans to attend law school to help others who experience race, class and gender discrimination.</p>
  <p>Before she begins to work in law and policy in the future, X said she hopes UCLA will address current policies, including
    holding UCLA Housing residents accountable to anti-discrimination policies.</p>
  <p>“I’m deeply admiring of X as an intellectual, as a community organizer, as my student and mentee,” Ribet said. “Her resilience,
    I think, has awed all of us and I am so deeplygrateful that she reached out … for support because it would have been
    a real loss for this campus if she had not been able to continue and graduate.”
  </p>
  <p>For now, X continues to look at the stars and paint her dreams.</p>
