<p>Nearly 40 of the most elite universities in the U.S. have more students from top
1 percent of income brackets than the bottom 60 percent. And that inequality is
readily visible in the University of California.</p>
<p>With rising tuition costs and housing prices, it&#39;s no wonder middle-class and
low-income Americans are not able to pay for higher education. To make ends
meet, more and more students have found themselves cutting costs in two
essential areas: food and housing.</p>
<p>The results are daunting: 56,000 students declared that they were homeless on
their 2013-2014 Free Application for Financial Federal Student Aid form. And
that number is a serious underestimate, since most homeless students do not
report their status. A University of California Global Food Initiative survey
found that one in fourten percent of their students are homeless. Affordable
student housing is clearly a problem the UC and the California state government
must contend with.</p>
<p>To meet the high demand for university education and enrollment increases in
line with the UCLA Housing Master Plan, UCLA is aiming to build three new
residence halls on the Hill and two apartment complexes in Westwood by 2021.
Although the proposal increases housing availability near the university, it
won&#39;t do anything to address homelessness for students who can&#39;t pay for housing
in the first place.</p>
<p>As such, UCLA Housing should set aside some of the beds in its new residential
halls and apartment complexes for students who experience extreme financial
crises or homelessness. The university should expand its short-term emergency
housing options and create long-term housing in these new buildings for students
who are experiencing chronic housing problems.</p>
<p>Alison Hewitt, a UCLA spokesperson, said students who experience financial
emergencies when paying for housing can seek agreements with UCLA Housing
Services to extend payment due dates without late fees. On the surface, this
seems sufficient. but it does little to help students. To secure an extension
without fees, students usually need to prove they&#39;re able to make payments,
something that students in severe financial crises won&#39;t be able to do. &lt;&lt;
attribution? If students don’t secure the extension and thus do not make a
payment, UCLA&#39;s registrar office will drop them from their classes, cancel their
housing contract and take away Bruincard access to their dorms or university
apartments.</p>
<p>Students in this situation may try to secure a short-term loan from UCLA to make
their housing payments. Bruins who dthao not work are only eligible to receive a
$200 loan – on the other hand, students who work can get up to a $350 loan – and
those loans must be repaid within a month&#39;s time. But, these types of loans are
band-aid solutions and force students to live loan-to-loan or worse, face
homelessness.</p>
<p>At the point where students are not able to prove they can make payments and are
no longer eligible for short-term loans, their last resort is to seek out the
Economic Crisis Response team.</p>
<p>The ECR team, which is funded by the Student Fund Advisory Committee, provides
14 to 20 days of housing in Sproul Hall for students who experience temporary
homelessness, said Maria Blandizzi, UCLA&#39;s dean for students.</p>
<p>This option seems great in theory. But any student who has lived in Westwood can
attest to it being nearly impossible to find sufficient housing in just 14 to 20
days. Additionally, the short-term housing does nothing for impoverished
students who are unable to pay for housing after the 14 to 20 day period. In
effect, the ECR team is at best a place for homeless students to crash for two
weeks before they return to being homeless again.</p>
<p>Claudia Pena, a UCLA Law professor who studies disability law, said she
interacted with UCLA Housing when she advocated on behalf of one of her students
who experienced homelessness as a result of not being able make housing
payments. Pena added she met with representatives from UCLA Housing to help her
student find housing, but found the process to be convoluted and long, and added
she thought UCLA is not equipped to help students find long-term housing.</p>
<p>&quot;UCLA Housing doesn&#39;t have enough processes in place to respond to these types
of situations,&quot; she said. &quot;Students have faced homelessness on campus multiple
time, and responses for students in poverty are limited.&quot;</p>
<p>And that&#39;s the point: homelessness is often not just a 20-day issue. Rather, it
can stem from a variety of financial and socioeconomic factors that are not
easily addressed by a two week sleepover in Sproul Hall or a $200 monthly loan.
Student homelessness is only exacerbated by the academic, financial and social
responsibilities Bruins have to keep up when they attend UCLA, and the
administration must be cognizant of that if it hopes to meet all students&#39;
needs.</p>
<p>As such, UCLA needs to allocate beds for students in extreme financial crisis or
homelessness in its Housing Master Plan Some of this housing should be free for
students who are homeless and do not have any way to pay for any sort of
housing. And UCLA can streamline the emergency housing process by allocating
some of its beds as short-term crisis housing and making it easy to reapply for
aid and loans and still make housing payments. Hewitt said UCLA Housing has not
yet finalized the specific number of beds or rooms in its new housing project,
meaning the university has the opportunity to earmark residences as homeless
student housing.</p>
<p>Of course, it may seem like students who are housing-insecure should just take
out loans. But federal and state loans are offered to students at the beginning
of the year, and the amount is not subject to change. Students who are partially
relying on these loans and on money from home could find themselves unable to
make payments if their financial situation at home changes. Reapplying for
federal and state loans in the middle of the year is difficult, and there is no
guarantee that students will be able to get the money they need.</p>
<p>And while private loans may seem a good alternate, the interest rates for these
loans are so high and students end up having to make payments as soon as they
take out the loan – something homeless and financially strained students would
likely not be able to do. Some students may not even have credit scores, making
them ineligible to take out these private loans.</p>
<p>UCLA prides itself on being an accessible and affordable campus for students.
But this so-called affordability needs to include all – regardless of their
housing security.</p>
