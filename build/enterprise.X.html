  <h1>Title</h1>
  &lt;p&gt;Beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to sleep each night brings a new dream, and a new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I have control of my dreams, so I can go anywhere I want to go,” X
said. “Nothing is ever too scary or major for me to handle (in my dreams).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X is a fifth-year gender studies student who has experienced homelessness as a
UCLA student. She has chosen to remain anonymous under the pseudonym X, which
reflects her identity as gender non-conforming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Compton, X lived with her mother, two older sisters and
occasionally her grandmother. For much of her childhood, her family lived below
the poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mom had schizophrenia and she didn’t have the medical resources she needed,”
X said. “Taking care of the family was put on her children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she knew she wanted to go to UCLA one day after going on a field trip to
campus in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a way for me to get out of my household and make opportunities for
myself,” X said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X had aspirations of becoming a doctor when she started attending UCLA, but she
found little representation of students of color or LGBTQ students in the
Biology Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I found my way to gender studies and they were supportive (of my identity),” X
said. “I was able to learn about myself, and things that I found were relevant
to the sciences that needed to (then) be applied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite finding a place in the gender studies department, X said her studies
were disrupted by periods of housing insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing Situation, Homelessness and food insecurity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1993, two-toned sedan that X bought before beginning classes at UCLA became
her shelter as she bounced between living in the dorms and couch-surfing during
winter quarter of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, X said she had been financially supporting herself and her mother
by working two jobs while balancing a full course load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said when she found herself in financial crisis, she researched her options on
campus, and contacted the Economic Crisis Response Team, or ECRT, for
assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were helpful in certain ways,” X said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, once the Office of Student Affairs connected her with ECRT, she said
she found the programs were ultimately unsympathetic. They put her in a
university apartment, but she said UCLA Housing and Student Affairs did not give
any consequences to the randomly assigned roommates she said discriminated
against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day X arrived at the apartment, her key did not work. She said she
knocked on the door, and saw people looking back at her through the peephole,
but they did not let her in. She said she had to contact UCLA Housing to give
her access instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(The roommates) didn’t say hi or welcome,” X said. “They said, ‘We like to keep
things clean around here.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While X was living in the apartment, she said the other roommates, who were
white, ignored her, but acted friendly with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They let me know I was unwelcome as a Black student, and as someone who is
gender non-conforming and queer,” X said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said her roommates stole her property and told her they did not want to live
with her because of her disability. X said she was managing Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder and was registered with the Center for Accessible Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she spoke with a UCLA housing mediator to manage the discomfort she felt
in her apartment, and said the mediator confirmed discrimination was common in
UCLA housing due to race, gender and sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After that mediation with UCLA that confirmed (discrimination was common), they
moved me to a more expensive unit and said (it was) for safety,” X said. “They
gave the apartment to my roommates and moved me to a more expensive unit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said UCLA Housing suggested the move to a different unit in University
Housing would be for her safety, but X added that disciplinary action was not
taken with her roommates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said UCLA did not adjust her financial aid package to compensate for the
increased price, and that the university then randomly assigned X to a roommate
in crisis. While in this unit, X said her roommate assaulted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The roommate deteriorated to the point where she had a breakdown,” X said. “She
began to throw plates at me, ... she started smashing stuff … (and) it ended
with her reaching for a knife.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she tried to disarm her roommate, and immediately called UCLA Housing,
requesting medical assistance. Instead, however, X said they dispatched campus
police, who then called LAPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said the police acted violently toward her and her roommate.She added the
police shoved the roommate facedown on the sofa while continuing to tighten her
handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that UCLA Housing said it was her responsibility to follow up with the
roommate after the incident, and then placed her in an even higher cost, single
studio apartment without adjusting her financial aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she received approval to have a therapy cat in the studio apartment. She
named the cat Aset, after a star system with a history connecting to African
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aset became a part of X’s artistic process, which she used as a way to channel
her traumatic experiences, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Aset) grew up watching me paint, so he used to sit on my lap when I was
painting (and) point to colors on the color palette,” X said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she had to give up her therapy animal because she was unable to keep up
with payments she accrued between the two apartments, and consequently lost her
housing for the summer of 2016. She said she was homeless from June 2016 until
January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time she became homeless, X said she stopped reaching out to campus
services because she felt she was being blamed for experiencing poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I met with ECRT, Student Affairs, LGBTQ Center, the Office of Diveristy, (but)
people would listen and not change,” X said. “Nothing changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X began adjusting to her new schedule while managing housing insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a struggle to be homeless because I still have these classes I need to
take, but when I leave this class I have to figure out where I’m going to park
my car,” X said. “You can’t rest because there’s so much going on, and you have
to balance school and a job and you don’t feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she went to the CPO Food Closet during her time as homeless, but did not
find the options appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like the canned food no one wants to eat at food drives,” X said. “But if
you don’t have a can opener, how are you going to eat it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added she has recently visited the CPO Food Closet located in the UCLA
Student Activities Center, and that she considers the current options better
than the ones she saw last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X added there were times during the last year when her life did not feel
sustainable. She added her focus was on survival after experiencing several
traumatic events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were points where I couldn’t envision myself in the future,” X said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intervention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December of 2016, X said that she was facing an enrollment hold on her UCLA
account because she had an unpaid housing balance. The unpaid housing balance
affected her financial aid disbursement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then reached out to a faculty mentor whom she took a class with, visiting
professor Beth Ribet, to receive additional support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After X explained how university policies contributed to her homelessness, Ribet
requested the involvement of three of X’s other professors, including professors
Grace Hong, Claudia Peña and Sarah Haley, who quickly became her personal team
of faculty advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As an individual student, I didn’t have that much power,” X said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By winter quarter 2017, X said UCLA threatened her with suspension because of
her unpaid housing balance, and she added by that time her financial aid and
enrollment were suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribet said that she, Hong, Haley and Peña intervened with the Office of Student
Affairs on X’s behalf. They drafted a several page memoranda detailing what had
happened to X while living in UCLA Housing. Next, Ribet said they visited the
Office of Student Affairs in person to restore X’s enrollment and financial aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she as she continued to have faculty intervene for her in the Office of
Student Affairs, the office began to cooperate with her in order to comply with
X’s disability accommodations, among other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was all within the week we all found out that X was about to lose complete
access to UCLA,” Ribet said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribet said she recalls receiving an email the night before X was supposed to
lose access notifying her the enrollment holds had been lifted. She added X then
enrolled in her classes, but was consequently dropped the following week because
of a non-payment hold with the Financial Aid Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Ribet and the professors intervened. She said Student Affairs would not
remove the hold until X had completed all of her coursework for which she still
had ‘incompletes’ from spring 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that while X was homeless and struggling with the holds, X finished
writing the final two essays to complete her course from spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After some bureaucratic mixups, her financial aid was restored,” Ribet said.
She added although grade changes had been approved, Student Affairs had
difficulty locating the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribet said X was then placed in emergency housing before settling in regular
housing. However, X had requested individual housing following experiences with
randomly assigned roommates she said were traumatic, but the cost of her studio
apartment exceeded her total financial aid package and amount allocated for
living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribet said that X appealed her remaining housing debt with UCLA, and eventually
had her housing payments from the year prior waived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Spring of 2017, Ribet said X was subjected to another financial aid hold,
which turned out to be a university error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To keep getting those notices was such a hard burden on X ... (if) every time
you’re told your financial aid is being taken away, you wound up homeless,”
Ribet said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she has since faced an additional enrollment hold during summer 2017 due
to a $30 ASUCLA textbook fee. She added although ASUCLA is not a UCLA entity,
they have access to freeze student enrollment&amp;gt; can we check this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve noticed this with other students,” Ribet said. “When professors don’t
cooperate (with a student’s disability accommodation), or don’t agree to give a
student the accommodation they’re entitled to, it’s often not resolved … (and)
UCLA doesn’t step in (to resolve it).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was homeless I felt like someone coming out of an abusive relationship
would feel like,” X said. “I felt like I was in an abusive relationship with
UCLA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Grace Hong, who teaches in both the Asian American Studies and Gender
Studies departments, said she has witnessed X be discriminated against by
different UCLA entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The level of dismissiveness, disrespect, I would even say contempt, that I have
personally seen UCLA staff show to X in front of me… has been shocking,” Hong
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one occasion when she accompanied X to the Student Affairs Office to address
her financial aid concerns, Hong said she thought the financial aid officer
acted like a collections agency by asking X how much total money she owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong added on another occasion, UCLA Housing employees cast doubt on whether the
instances of discrimination and abuse X reported actually happened by using
conditional language: ‘if’ assault and discrimination occurred, not ‘when.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribet added that at a meeting with both UCLA Housing and the Office of Student
Affairs, she said she remembers hearing an Office of Student Affairs employee
say X had been making poor financial choices, and implied that was part of the
reason she was homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They had judgments about her being a caretaker...for a mentally ill parent,”
Ribet said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong added that not only did she think Student Affairs implied X must be
mismanaging her finances, but that the four faculty members who were identifying
themselves as her advocates would no longer want to advocate for X if she had
been financially irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was this assumption that once (Student Affairs) explained to us how much
they had tried to help, and (that) X had made these bad choices and wasn’t
deserving of more help, that we would fall in line in pathologizing X,” Hong
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong said her experience helping X navigate various student support systems has
changed her perspective of how the university attempts to support students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bureaucratic insanity that is housing, student affairs, CAE, financial aid,
ECRT, the registrar...makes it hard to see who to go to and who is in charge of
what,” Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added she believes the system ultimately negatively affects diversity on
campus. Hong said that oftentimes, underrepresented students can only find safe
comfortable environments in activist groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X is currently in a University Housing studio apartment and is preparing for law
school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to share her story now, before she graduates, because she knows there
are other students who haven’t been able to come forward about similar
situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m tired all the time and still going through a lot of trauma,” X said. “I
know I’m a survivor, I know it takes a lot of strength to have gotten through
all of this, to survive everything UCLA has thrown at me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painting, photography and poetry are outlets for X’s stress and trauma. She even
performs stand-up comedy when she has time between work and classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I use art as a form of healing and activism,” X said. “I work with students (in
local, underserved communities) where we write poetry (and) draw on photos to
express how different forms of oppression impact us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X said she plans to attend law school to help others who experience race, class
and gender discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she begins to work in law and policy in the future, X said she hopes UCLA
will address current policies, including holding UCLA Housing residents
accountable to anti-discrimination policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m deeply admiring of X as an intellectual, as a community organizer, as my
student and mentee,” Ribet said. “Her resilience, I think, has awed all of us
and I am so deeplygrateful that she reached out … for support because it would
have been a real loss for this campus if she had not been able to continue and
graduate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, X continues to look at the stars and paint her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
